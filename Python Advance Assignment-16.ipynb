What is the benefit of regular expressions?\nAns: Regular Expressions, also known as regex or regexp, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of if/else statements.\n\n",

These functions are very efficient and fast for searching in strings. The function searches for some substring in a string and returns a match object if found, else it returns none.\n\nThere is a difference between the use of both functions. Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but re.match() searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns none.\n\nWhile re.search() searches for the whole string even if the string contains multi-lines and tries to find a match of the substring in all the lines of string\n\nimport re\nSubstring ='string' \nString1 ='We are learning regex with geeksforgeeks regex is very useful for string matching.

Using Character set in square Brackets searches for all the character set in the square bracket and if match is found, it returns it.\n",
