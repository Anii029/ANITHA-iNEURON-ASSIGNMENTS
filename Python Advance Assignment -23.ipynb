If you have any, what are your choices for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph?\nAns: Matplotlib provides a convenient method called subplots for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph. Subplots mean a group of smaller axes (where each axis is a plot) that can exist together within a single figure.\n\n",

Can you explain the benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound after reading this chapter?\nAns: Compound interest makes a sum of money grow at a faster rate than simple interest,because in addition to earning returns on the money you invest, you also earn returns on those returns at the end of every compounding period, which could be daily, monthly, quarterly or annually.\n\n",
